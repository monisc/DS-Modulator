## MATLAB Simulation Scripts

Both scripts take as the input a vector with the signal samples.

The results were produced using a 1 kHz sine wave as input and a modulator frequency of 1 MHz.

They were as expected, the output signal is an amplified version of the input and the frequency components that would cause distortion are pushed to higher frequencies of the spectrum. This is the predicted response of a Delta-Sigma modulator.
